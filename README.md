# Frontend Mentor – 3-Column Preview Card Component

This project is a solution to the [3-column preview card component challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/3column-preview-card-component-pH92eAR2-) on Frontend Mentor. It helped me practice SCSS structuring, using Flexbox for layout, and working with Vite.

## 📋 Project Overview

The goal was to create a responsive layout with three feature cards using clean and reusable SCSS. I used **Flexbox** for layout and **Vite** for fast development and build processes.

## 💡 What I Practiced

- Setting up and using **Vite** with SCSS
- Creating **responsive layouts** with Flexbox
- Managing SCSS structure and partials
- Working through image scaling issues
- Deploying static projects (faced CSS load issue on GitHub Pages)

## 🛠️ Built With

- HTML5
- SCSS
- Flexbox
